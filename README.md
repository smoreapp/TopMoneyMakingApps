# Here's how this website works:

It's essentailly an un-paginated blog. Each post is displayed (in assecending date order) on the single page of this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) [theme](https://github.com/t413/SinglePaged). 

## Setup
* The page title and meta description is set in config.yml
* Post dated 2000-01-01 is the jumbotron section
- The image is set as the `bg:` property. You can choose to use a defined color alias (set in config.yml) or a hex code or a url(). It essentially sets the definition for the css `background{}` property. If you're not using a color alias, you need to place what you want between single quotes. 
** For the most part, there's no need for text (other than the h1) in the intro post.
* post dated 2000-01-02 contains the content. This is where post goes.
* To think about it in a WordPress sense, 2000-01-01 is the title, 2000-01-02 is the body.
